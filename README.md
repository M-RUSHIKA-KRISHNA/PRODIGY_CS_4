Simple Keylogger in Python
This project demonstrates the creation of a simple keylogger using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The keylogger captures keystrokes and logs them with timestamps to a file, providing a basic yet effective way to monitor keyboard activity. It leverages the pynput library for cross-platform compatibility, ensuring it works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This project is intended for educational purposes only, highlighting the importance of ethical use and the necessity of obtaining explicit permission before running a keylogger on any device.
